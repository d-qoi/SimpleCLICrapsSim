Incomplete

This is a simple CLI game based on the game of Craps.

The game state will advance if players "roll" the dice, however the only bets that will be calculated are (Don't)Come, and (Done't)Pass.

Most of the betting architecture is in place, but the implementation is not finished.

Also may not have a makefile.
